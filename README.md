# [2017 Fall] Data Structure and Programming Final
### FRAIG (Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph)

Designed and implemented algorithm to reduce gate counts of circuits with functional equivalence.</br>
Go to folder **doc** to see more detailsof this project.

### Objectives

1. Putting everything you learn in a project.
2. Using hash to detect structurally equivalent signals in a circuit.
3. Performing Boolean logic simulations and designing your own data structure to identify functionally equivalent candidate pairs in the circuit.
4. Being able to call Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove the functional equivalence.
5. Writing a professional project report.
